Finding myself
# My Name is Ameenah
## I am 47 yrs old
<P> When you spend your entire life taking cate of others you forget how to take care of yourself. I came to Meritt to start over, to start living for me. <br>
I have been a mother since I was <em><strong> 13 </strong></em>. All of society has written me off as unimportant. I am here to <em><strong> break</ strong> </em> <em> barriers </em>and change the direction of my entire family. </P>
